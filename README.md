# Hiroas
Public Description

Hiroas started as a project in cooperation with students and professors of the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

With the leading experts from finance and IT we made it our goal to develop not just a new Cryptocurrency, but a completly 
new approach to decentralized currency overall.


# Goethe University trading algorithm (A little Roadmap)
The newest approach of a trading algorithm was inspired by the BlackRock algorithm.
Because of this algorithm, Laurence Fink became the most powerful man in the whole USA. The algorithm isn't public, self speaking but we made it our goal to develop our own version.

In the test phase our algorithm made a steady 25% profit, each year, while trading Cryptocurrencies for four Years now.
So now we know that its time.
Rougly speaking Goethe Universities algorithm takes news, hints and calls from all over the world and converts it to useable data. A team of 7 professors worked on this project for over 7 years now.

Abstract: The Hiroas software introduces a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal 
scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct 
upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, 
asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across hundreds of CPU cores or clusters. 
The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of 
transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.

Hiroas is the first ever closed-end fund focused on applying the latest advances in deep learning research combined with
financial expertise. Hiroas will provide an opportunity for anyone interested in being part of a new generation fund 
that will reduce the risks and complications in favor of using Deep Learning techniques. We are developing 
complex trading models and strategies with the possibility of learning, developing and improving over time. 
Hiroas is a level above the conventional solutions and will allow obtaining great returns of the investment from the 
first days thanks to the technology that is behind her.

True decentralization and automation are carried out in the background, where Hiroas' learning will be constant. This is something that many Wall Street investment funds are already experimenting to maximize profits and optimize their efforts. We decided that it is time to generate equality for all by pulling down technological barriers and guaranteeing access to the latest technology to any interested investor. This is what we are passionate about.

  Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 with the launch of the bitcoin currency, and since then entrepreneurs 
  and developers have been attempting to generalize the technology in order to support a wider range of applications
  on a single blockchain platform.

While a number of blockchain platforms have struggled to support functional decentralized applications, 
application specific blockchains such as the BitShares decentralized exchange (2014) and Steem social media platform (2016) 
have become heavily used blockchains with tens of thousands of daily active users. 
They have achieved this by increasing performance to thousands of transactions per second, reducing latency to 1.5 seconds, 
eliminating fees, and providing a user experience similar to those currently provided by existing centralized services.

Existing blockchain platforms are burdened by large fees and limited computational capacity that prevent widespread 
blockchain adoption.

# Support Millions of Users

Disrupting businesses such as Ebay, Uber, AirBnB, and Facebook, require blockchain technology capable of handling tens of 
millions of active daily users. In certain cases, applications may not work unless a critical mass of users is reached 
and therefore a platform that can handle mass number of users is paramount.

# Free Usage

Application developers need the flexibility to offer users free services; users should not have to pay in order
to use the platform or benefit from its services. A blockchain platform that is free to use for users will likely 
gain more widespread adoption. Developers and businesses can then create effective monetization strategies.

# Easy Upgrades and Bug Recovery

Businesses building blockchain based applications need the flexibility to enhance their applications with new features.

All non-trivial software is subject to bugs, even with the most rigorous of formal verification. 
The platform must be robust enough to fix bugs when they inevitably occur.




You may purchase the Hiroas only after getting in contact with us via coin@hiroas.xyz
Any donations made prior can benefit your position in the investor pool.


During the ICO, 100% of the tokens will be distributed, that is, 10,000,000 of Hiroas Tokens (Total Supply). The number of the Hiroas Tokens allowed for purchase by one user is unlimited at fixed price of $0,20 per Hiroas Token. The Hiroas Tokens will be issued only once. The Hiroas Tokens will be Ethereum-based cryptographic tokens of value.

# So, Hiroas...

Hiroas will choose the assets (a mixture of bitcoin, ethereum, altcoins, tokens and other cryptoassets) based on our complex trading models and strategies that we made thanks to the use of Deep Learning techniques combined with our financial expertise.

Before being available, there will be a beta available and a training period and model test for Hiroas where all results will be publicly accessible. Thanks to the technology behind Hiroas and the trading models developed, she will be able to choose her investment approach and vary the strategies in a self-determined way (monitored by our team at all times) according to the conditions and moments of the market. The portfolio can be monitored by any investor thanks to our monitoring and auditing tools. In addition, external bimonthly auditions will be conducted to provide the necessary transparency to investors.

# Transaction Confirmation

Typical DPOS blockchains have 100% block producer participation. A transaction can be considered confirmed with 99.9% certainty after an average of 1.5 seconds from time of broadcast.

There are some extraordinary cases where a software bug, Internet congestion, or a malicious block producer will create two or more forks. For absolute certainty that a transaction is irreversible, a node may choose to wait for confirmation by 15 out of the 21 block producers. Based on a typical configuration of the Hiroas software, this will take an average of 45 seconds under normal circumstances. By default all nodes will consider a block confirmed by 15 of 21 producers irreversible and will not switch to a fork that excludes such a block regardless of length.

It is possible for a node to warn users that there is a high probability that they are on a minority fork within 9 seconds of the start of a fork. After 2 consecutive missed blocks there is a 95% probability a node is on a minority fork. With 3 consecutive missed blocks there is a 99% certainty of being on a minority fork. It is possible to generate a robust predictive model that will utilize information about which nodes missed, recent participation rates, and other factors to quickly warn operators that something is wrong.

The response to such a warning depends entirely upon the nature of the business transactions, but the simplest response is to wait for 15/21 confirmations until the warning stops.

# Transaction as Proof of Stake (TaPoS)

The Hiroas software requires every transaction to include the hash of a recent block header. This hash serves two purposes:

prevents a replay of a transaction on forks that do not include the referenced block; and
signals the network that a particular user and their stake are on a specific fork.
Over time all users end up directly confirming the blockchain which makes it difficult to forge counterfeit chains as the counterfeit would not be able to migrate transactions from the legitimate chain.

# Accounts

The Hiroas software permits all accounts to be referenced by a unique human readable name of 2 to 32 characters in length. The name is chosen by the creator of the account. All accounts must be funded with the minimal account balance at the time they are created to cover the cost of storing account data. Account names also support namespaces such that the owner of account @domain is the only one who can create the account @user.domain.

In a decentralized context, application developers will pay the nominal cost of account creation to sign up a new user. Traditional businesses already spend significant sums of money per customer they acquire in the form of advertising, free services, etc. The cost of funding a new blockchain account should be insignificant in comparison. Fortunately, there is no need to create accounts for users already signed up by another application.

# Messages & Handlers

Each account can send structured messages to other accounts and may define scripts to handle messages when they are received. The Hiroas software gives each account its own private database which can only be accessed by its own message handlers. Message handling scripts can also send messages to other accounts. The combination of messages and automated message handlers is how Hiroas defines smart contracts.

# Role Based Permission Management

Permission management involves determining whether or not a message is properly authorized. The simplest form of permission management is checking that a transaction has the required signatures, but this implies that required signatures are already known. Generally authority is bound to individuals or groups of individuals and is often compartmentalized. The Hiroas software provides a declarative permission management system that gives accounts fine grained and high level control over who can do what and when.

It is critical that authentication and permission management be standardized and separate from the business logic of the application. This enables tools to be developed to manage permissions in a general purpose manner and also provide significant opportunities for performance optimization.

Every account may be controlled by any weighted combination of other accounts and private keys. This creates a hierarchical authority structure that reflects how permissions are organized in reality, and makes multi-user control over funds easier than ever. Multi-user control is the single biggest contributor to security, and, when used properly, it can greatly eliminate the risk of theft due to hacking.

Hiroas software allows accounts to define what combination of keys and/or accounts can send a particular message type to another account. For example, it is possible to have one key for a user's social media account and another for access to the exchange. It is even possible to give other accounts permission to act on behalf of a user's account without assigning them keys.

# Named Permission Levels



Using the Hiroas software, accounts can define named permission levels each of which can be derived from higher level named permissions. Each named permission level defines an authority; an authority is a threshold multi-signature check consisting of keys and/or named permission levels of other accounts. For example, an account's "Friend" permission level can be set for the account to be controlled equally by any of the account's friends.

Another example is the Steem blockchain which has three hard-coded named permission levels: owner, active, and posting. The posting permission can only perform social actions such as voting and posting, while the active permission can do everything except change the owner. The owner permission is meant for cold storage and is able to do everything. The Hiroas software generalizes this concept by allowing each account holder to define their own hierarchy as well as the grouping of actions.

# Named Message Handler Groups

The Hiroas software allows each account to organize its own message handlers into named and nested groups. These named message handler groups can be referenced by other accounts when they configure their permission levels.

The highest level message handler group is the account name and the lowest level is the individual message type being received by the account. These groups can be referenced like so: @accountname.groupa.subgroupb.MessageType.

Under this model it is possible for an exchange contract to group order creation and canceling separately from deposit and withdraw. This grouping by the exchange contract is a convenience for users of the exchange.

# Permission Mapping

Hiroas software allows each account to define a mapping between a Named Message Handler Group of any account and their own Named Permission Level. For example, an account holder could map the account holder's social media application to the account holder's "Friend" permission group. With this mapping, any friend could post as the account holder on the account holder's social media. Even though they would post as the account holder, they would still use their own keys to sign the message. This means it is always possible to identify which friends used the account and in what way.

# Evaluating Permissions

When delivering a message of type "Action", from @alice to @bob the Hiroas software will first check to see if @alice has defined a permission mapping for @bob.groupa.subgroup.Action. If nothing is found then a mapping for @bob.groupa.subgroup then @bob.groupa, and lastly @bob will be checked. If no further match is found, then the assumed mapping will be to the named permission group @alice.active.

Once a mapping is identified then signing authority is validated using the threshold multi-signature process and the authority associated with the named permission. If that fails, then it traverses up to the parent permission and ultimately to the owner permission, @alice.owner.



# Default Permission Groups

The Hiroas technology also allows all accounts to have an "owner" group which can do everything, and an "active" group which can do everything except change the owner group. All other permission groups are derived from "active".

# Parallel Evaluation of Permissions

The permission evaluation process is "read-only" and changes to permissions made by transactions do not take effect until the end of a block. This means that all keys and permission evaluation for all transactions can be executed in parallel. Furthermore, this means that a rapid validation of permission is possible without starting the costly application logic that would have to be rolled back. Lastly, it means that transaction permissions can be evaluated as pending transactions are received and do not need to be re-evaluated as they are applied.

All things considered, permission verification represents a significant percentage of the computation required to validate transactions. Making this a read-only and trivially parallelizable process enables a dramatic increase in performance.

When replaying the blockchain to regenerate the deterministic state from the log of messages there is no need to evaluate the permissions again. The fact that a transaction is included in a known good block is sufficient to skip this step. This dramatically reduces the computational load associated with replaying an ever growing blockchain.

# Messages with Mandatory Delay

Time is a critical component of security. In most cases, it is not possible to know if a private key has been stolen until it has been used. Time based security is even more critical when people have applications that require keys be kept on computers connected to the internet for daily use. The Hiroas software enables application developers to indicate that certain messages must wait a minimum period of time after being included in a block before they can be applied. During this time they can be cancelled.

Users can then receive notice via email or text message when one of these messages is broadcast. If they did not authorize it, then they can use the account recovery process to recover their account and retract the message.

The required delay depends upon how sensitive an operation is. Paying for a coffee can have no delay and be irreversible in seconds, while buying a house may require a 72 hour clearing period. Transferring an entire account to new control may take up to 30 days. The exact delays chosen are up to application developers and users.

# Recovery from Stolen Keys

The Hiroas software provides users a way to restore control of their account when their keys are stolen. An account owner can use any owner key that was active in the last 30 days along with approval from their designated account recovery partner to reset the owner key on their account. The account recovery partner cannot reset control of the account without the help of the owner.

There is nothing for the hacker to gain by attempting to go through the recovery process because they already "control" the account. Furthermore, if they did go through the process, the recovery partner would likely demand identification and multi-factor authentication (phone and email). This would likely compromise the hacker or gain the hacker nothing in the process.

This process is also very different from a simple multi-signature arrangement. With a multi-signature transaction, there is another company that is party to every transaction that is executed, but with the recovery process the agent is only a party to the recovery process and has no power over the day-to-day transactions. This dramatically reduces costs and legal liabilities for everyone involved.

# Deterministic Parallel Execution of Applications

Blockchain consensus depends upon deterministic (reproducible) behavior. This means all parallel execution must be free from the use of mutexes or other locking primitives. Without locks there must be some way to guarantee that all accounts can only read and write their own private database. It also means that each account processes messages sequentially and that parallelism will be at the account level.

In an Hiroas software-based blockchain, it is the job of the block producer to organize message delivery into independent threads so that they can be evaluated in parallel. The state of each account depends only upon the messages delivered to it. The schedule is the output of a block producer and will be deterministically executed, but the process for generating the schedule need not be deterministic. This means that block producers can utilize parallel algorithms to schedule transactions.

Part of parallel execution means that when a script generates a new message it does not get delivered immediately, instead it is scheduled to be delivered in the next cycle. The reason it cannot be delivered immediately is because the receiver may be actively modifying its own state in another thread.

# Minimizing Communication Latency

Latency is the time it takes for one account to send a message to another account and then receive a response. The goal is to enable two accounts to exchange messages back and forth within a single block without having to wait 3 seconds between each message. To enable this, the Hiroas software divides each block into cycles. Each cycle is divided into threads and each thread contains a list of transactions. Each transaction contains a set of messages to be delivered. This structure can be visualized as a tree where alternating layers are processed sequentially and in parallel.

  Block

    Cycles (sequential)

      Threads (parallel)

        Transactions (sequential)

          Messages (sequential)

            Receiver and Notified Accounts (parallel)
Transactions generated in one cycle can be delivered in any subsequent cycle or block. Block producers will keep adding cycles to a block until the maximum wall clock time has passed or there are no new generated transactions to deliver.

It is possible to use static analysis of a block to verify that within a given cycle no two threads contain transactions that modify the same account. So long as that invariant is maintained a block can be processed by running all threads in parallel.

# Proof of Completeness

When using merkle proofs from outside blockchains, there is a significant difference between knowing that all transactions processed are valid and knowing that no transactions have been skipped or omitted. While it is impossible to prove that all of the most recent transactions are known, it is possible to prove that there have been no gaps in the transaction history. The Hiroas software facilitates this by assigning a sequence number to every message delivered to every account. A user can use these sequence numbers to prove that all messages intended for a particular account have been processed and that they were processed in order.

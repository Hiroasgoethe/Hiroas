# Hiroas
Public Description

Hiroas started as a project in cooperation with students and professors of the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

With the leading experts from finance and IT we made it our goal to develop not just a new Cryptocurrency, but a completly 
new approach to decentralized currency overall.

Abstract: The Hiroas software introduces a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal 
scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct 
upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, 
asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across hundreds of CPU cores or clusters. 
The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of 
transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.

Hiroas is the first ever closed-end fund focused on applying the latest advances in deep learning research combined with
financial expertise. Hiroas will provide an opportunity for anyone interested in being part of a new generation fund 
that will reduce the risks and complications in favor of using Deep Learning techniques. We are developing 
complex trading models and strategies with the possibility of learning, developing and improving over time. 
Hiroas is a level above the conventional solutions and will allow obtaining great returns of the investment from the 
first days thanks to the technology that is behind her.

True decentralization and automation are carried out in the background, where Hiroas' learning will be constant. This is something that many Wall Street investment funds are already experimenting to maximize profits and optimize their efforts. We decided that it is time to generate equality for all by pulling down technological barriers and guaranteeing access to the latest technology to any interested investor. This is what we are passionate about.


Goals:

  Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 with the launch of the bitcoin currency, and since then entrepreneurs 
  and developers have been attempting to generalize the technology in order to support a wider range of applications
  on a single blockchain platform.

While a number of blockchain platforms have struggled to support functional decentralized applications, 
application specific blockchains such as the BitShares decentralized exchange (2014) and Steem social media platform (2016) 
have become heavily used blockchains with tens of thousands of daily active users. 
They have achieved this by increasing performance to thousands of transactions per second, reducing latency to 1.5 seconds, 
eliminating fees, and providing a user experience similar to those currently provided by existing centralized services.

Existing blockchain platforms are burdened by large fees and limited computational capacity that prevent widespread 
blockchain adoption.

Support Millions of Users

Disrupting businesses such as Ebay, Uber, AirBnB, and Facebook, require blockchain technology capable of handling tens of 
millions of active daily users. In certain cases, applications may not work unless a critical mass of users is reached 
and therefore a platform that can handle mass number of users is paramount.

###Free Usage

Application developers need the flexibility to offer users free services; users should not have to pay in order
to use the platform or benefit from its services. A blockchain platform that is free to use for users will likely 
gain more widespread adoption. Developers and businesses can then create effective monetization strategies.

Easy Upgrades and Bug Recovery

Businesses building blockchain based applications need the flexibility to enhance their applications with new features.

All non-trivial software is subject to bugs, even with the most rigorous of formal verification. 
The platform must be robust enough to fix bugs when they inevitably occur.
